/*
URL :   /# means No URL

        main_domain/path : Provides our application routing
        e.g: localhost:5173/subscribe  - Go to subscribe page

SPA(Single Page Application) - Internally Component gets loaded for different purposes without re-loading the entire application.  

Disadvantage of SPA is that everytime on page load it will loads the same page i.e HOMe(in most case) with same URL we can not redirect to a perticular page to our application. This can be solve by routing to the page, So we here using React Router(we can use othe routers as well for emmeddeing with React application) which can solve routing to any perticular page with one click rather only on the HOME page or first page i.e default page of React app.
